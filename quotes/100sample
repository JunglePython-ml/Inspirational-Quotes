The only people who never fail are those who never try
Failure is just another way to learn how to do something right
I failed my way to success
Every failure brings with it the seed of an equivalent success
Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly
It is hard to fail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed
Imagination is more important than knowledge
Hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams
Go confidently in the direction of your dreams Live the life you have imagined
You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus
Commitment leads to action Action brings your dream closer
I never think of the future
Dont waste your life in doubts and fears Spend yourself on the work before you well assured that the right performance of this hours duties will be the best preparation for the hours or ages that follow it
Do not anticipate trouble or worry about what may never happen Keep in the sunlight
Take time to deliberate but when the time for action arrives stop thinking and go in
The mind that is anxious about future events is miserable

Our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselves

The only journey is the one within
Follow your honest convictions and stay strong
The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts therefore guard accordingly
Action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action
Happiness depends more on the inward disposition of mind than on outward circumstances
There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something
Happiness is not a goal but a byproduct
Happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling
Purpose is what gives life a meaning
The significance of a man is not in what he attains but in what he longs to attain
In all things that you do consider the end
Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives
The virtue lies in the struggle not in the prize
To reach a port we must sail

A wise man learns by the mistakes of others a fool by his own
No man was ever wise by chance
In everything the ends well defined are the secret of durable success
Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another
A goal is a dream with a deadline
Most impossible goals can be met simply by breaking them down into bitesize chunks writing them down believing them and then going full speed ahead as if they were routine
Goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement
We are what we repeatedly do Excellence therefore is not an act but a habit
Take risks and youll get the payoffs Learn from your mistakes until you succeed Its that simple
The best way out is always through

Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome
Dont bunt Aim out of the ballpark
The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something It’s as simple as that A lot of people have ideas but there are few who decide to do something about them now Not tomorrow Not next week But today The true entrepreneur is a doer not a dreamer
Never give in
Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning

To never forget that the most important thing in life is the quality of life we lead
Its better to own the racecourse then the race horse
When you go to buy don’t show your silver
It’s easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission
To win without risk is to triumph without glory
Example is not the main thing in influencing other people it’s the only thing
